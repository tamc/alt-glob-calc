Climate science,How confident are we in climate models?,45,B,Various methods are used to account for the fact that numerical models cannot represent the full range of our uncertainty about the future climate.,,Show only the raw range of output from climate models.,"Generate an uncertainty range based on model output, using a method similar to the most recent IPCC report, to account for unmodelled phenomena.",Low confidence in climate models.  Show alternative evidence for climate impacts.,
